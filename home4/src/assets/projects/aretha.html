    Virtual assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa, the Google Home, and Apple's Siri 
    are now being used by millions of users, every day.  As they have become more
    sophisticated, people have begun using them for many kinds of things beyond
    checking the weather: shopping, scheduling, time keeping, among others.

    As these devices become more central to people's lives, they start to get privileged
    access to many private aspects of people's lives: not only access to their private spaces,
    such as what is said at home or in the bedroom, but also the kinds of things people do 
    and buy.  Colluding with smartphone apps, such devices will soon be able to infer your
    emotional and physical state, your plans and intents, your income, your conditions, and
    your personal activities.

    How do we know these virtual assistants are genuinely serving their users with
    their best interests in mind?  How do we also know what the companies behind these
    devices will do with your data?  
</p>

<p>  
    As we have written previously about "respectful AI", this is not <i>just</i> about 
    privacy, although privacy is an important element. This is about whether such 
    assistants genuinely serve you with your best interests in mind. Will a large online retailer, such as Amazon, always design its virtual assistant to get you only the things you need via the best means of getting them--or might they, for example, design their virtual assistant to make them more money, such as making you want more things?    
</p>

<p>
    We think that, in the future, the growing importance of virtual assistants will underscore the need for neutral virtual assistants <i>for and by the people</i>.  By "by the people", we mean non-retailers, non-advertising companies, but free an open source developers who genuinely are neutral and have users' best interests in mind. 

</p>
<p>     
    Towards that end, we have taken the first step with ARETHA (* Artificial Respect-Embodying roboT for Human Autonomy) project a FOSS Virtual Assistnat platform for experimenting with respectful behaviours using DIY hardware for a smarter home.
