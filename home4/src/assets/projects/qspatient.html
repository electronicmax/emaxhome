    Do you have a FitBit, Apple Watch, Jawbone or other fitness tracker? People
    are increasingly tracking many aspects of their lives-from their daily 
    exercise and movement routines, their diets, to their moods, symptoms
    and well-being.

    Is all this data going to good use?  While some studies have revealed ways
    that some have benefitted from this data, its application in clinical
    practice has thus far been very minimal.  In this project, we look at the
    <i>reasons why self-tracked data</i> are not yet used in medical workflows.
    We investigate whether this is because of the data itself, medical practice,
    or the devices and applications used to view and explore the data.

    Through a mixed-methods investigation, including working closely with 
    various healthcare professionals, we have found many factors are responsible:
    ranging from data quality, and relevance, to inadequate consideration of 
    clinical decisions, constraints, practices, and workflows.  In short, the ways that
    evidence based medicine (EBM) scrutinises evidence is sigificantly more rigorous
    than current self-tracking systems support.
