    Apps, devices, and services typically share data about users with 
    multiple-sometimes dozens-of different companies and organisations

    practicies might put them at risk.

    We feel that an important first step in helping people protect
    themselves online is to be able to understand how their data 
    is being used, by whom, and what they can do about it.  To 
    this end, the X-Ray Project has worked on several tools and systems
    to make data collection and processing activities of apps, services
    and devices, <b>knowable and actionable</b>.
