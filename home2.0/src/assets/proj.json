            "summary": "While the Quantified Self and personal informatics fields have focused on the individual's use of self-logged data about themselves, the same kinds of data could, in theory, be used to improve diagnosis and care planning. \n In this project, we seek to understand both the opportunities and bottlenecks in the use of self-logged data for differential diagnosis and care planning during patient visits to both primary and secondary care.  \n  Included in the work we have done in this project are literature reviews to identify potential factors influencing the use of self-logged data in clinical settings, interview, and role-play studies, in which we applied a vignette-based role-play approach with general practitioners and hospital specialists in the US and UK, to elicit reflections on and insights about using patient self-logged data. Our analysis reveals multiple opportunities for the use of self-logged data in the differential diagnosis workflow, identifying capture, representational, and interpretational challenges that are potentially preventing self-logged data from being effectively interpreted and applied by clinicians to derive a patient's prognosis and plan of care.",

It includes the App Observatory, a new research tool that automatically downloads, disassembles, analyses, and aggregates analyses of apps from app marketplaces around the world, providing convenient APIs for popular data science frameworks.",
